## Version Discrepancies

The Expo terminal output shows multiple package version incompatibilities:

### Current vs. Expected Versions

| Package | Current Version | Expected Version |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| expo | 52.0.33 | ~52.0.36 |
| expo-camera | 14.0.5 (in package.json) / 14.1.3 (reported) | ~16.0.17 |
| expo-constants | 17.0.5 | ~17.0.7 |
| expo-font | 13.0.3 | ~13.0.4 |
| expo-image-picker | 15.0.2 (in package.json) / 15.1.0 (reported) | ~16.0.6 |
| expo-media-library | 16.0.1 (in package.json) / 16.0.5 (reported) | ~17.0.6 |
| expo-splash-screen | 0.29.21 | ~0.29.22 |
| react-native | 0.76.6 | 0.76.7 |
| react-native-gesture-handler | 2.23.0 (in package.json) / 2.23.1 (reported) | ~2.20.2 |
| react-native-screens | 4.4.0 (in package.json) / 4.6.0 (reported) | ~4.4.0 |
| react-native-svg | 15.11.1 | 15.8.0 |
| @shopify/flash-list | 1.6.3 | 1.7.3 |

## Major Compatibility Issues

The most significant issues appear to be:

1. **expo-camera**: Using version 14.x when version 16.x is expected for Expo SDK 52
2. **expo-media-library**: Using version 16.x when version 17.x is expected 
3. **expo-image-picker**: Using version 15.x when version 16.x is expected

## Possible Upgrade Command

To resolve these issues, you might consider running:

```bash
npx expo install expo-camera@~16.0.17 expo-constants@~17.0.7 expo-font@~13.0.4 expo-image-picker@~16.0.6 expo-media-library@~17.0.6 expo-splash-screen@~0.29.22 react-native@0.76.7 react-native-gesture-handler@~2.20.2 react-native-screens@~4.4.0 react-native-svg@15.8.0 @shopify/flash-list@1.7.3
```

However, this would require careful testing and adjustment of your code to work with the updated packages.

## Camera Package Critical Issues

The most critical issue is with the expo-camera package:

1. The package.json lists version 14.0.5
2. The terminal reports version 14.1.3
3. The expected version for compatibility is ~16.0.17
4. There are significant API changes between version 14.x and 16.x

This mismatch is likely the root cause of the errors with the Camera component.
